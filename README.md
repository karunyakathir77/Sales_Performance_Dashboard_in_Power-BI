# Sales Performance using Power BI
## Objective
In this project, the Power BI dashboard aims to help stakeholders gain actionable insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, and regional performance. It enables detailed exploration using slicers across time periods, segments, product categories, and locations.
## Dataset
- Source: kaggle.com
- Size: approx. 1000 records
- Key Fields:
    - Order/Customer/Product IDs
    - Order/Ship Dates
    - Segment/Category/Sub-Category/Products
    - Region/Country/State/City
    - Sales/Quantity/Profit.
## Analysis
- Leveraged DAX functions to create date hierarchies (Year, Quarter)
- Visualized sales and profit trends over period.
- Analyzed performance across:
  - Sales & Profit By Year/Segment/Categories
  - Sales & Profit By Region/Year
- Utilized slicers/filters for interactive exploration
## Key Questions Addressed
* Which year had the highest sales and profit?
* Which quarter in each year showed the highest or lowest performance?
* Which customer segment requires more focus to boost growth?
* Which product category delivers strong returns to justify expansion or new offerings?
* Which regions/states drive the most revenue and profit?
## Findings
* **Peak Years**: Recent two years (2016–2017) showed significant increases in both sales and profit.
* **Seasonal Trend**: Q4 consistently yields the highest sales—possibly due to holiday season demand.
* **Top Segment**: The Consumer segment leads in revenue contribution.
* **High-performing Category**: Technology products dominate in both sales and profitability.
* **Top Regions**: Western and Eastern U.S. states, particularly California and New York, show high performance.
## Strategic Recommendations
* Focus on upselling and cross-selling in high-performing categories like Technology.
* Develop localized product strategies to cater to underperforming regions, aligning with cultural preferences.
* Explore market penetration and product development strategies in strong-performing segments and states.
* Analyze factors driving recent success and institutionalize best practices.
* Implement data-driven evaluations of future strategies to optimize outcomes.
## Overall Outcome
The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by identifying trends and performance gaps. It empowers stakeholders to strategize effectively based on concrete metrics, ensuring sustainable growth and customer satisfaction.
